# About :point_down:

[openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API was used to retrieve weather data.

The purpose of this project was to get some practice working with an API and displaying information to the DOM.

Deployed using [Github-pages](https://colinthedev.github.io/9999th-weather-app/).

To test locations:

* In dev tools click on "customize and control Devtools" (found in the upper right corner).
* scroll over "More tools".
* select "sensors".
<br>
you can now change location to view various results. 

# Design

When creating the background i wanted a color scheme that would compliment the icons while maintaining a clear and easy to read UI, at the same time conveying a sense of night or day.

When creating the graph for the air quality index i chose colors that clearly displayed a sense of good intermediate and bad.

>The icons were made by hosein_bagheri.<br>
>They can be found [here](https://uifreebies.net/icon/3d-weather-icons-free).
